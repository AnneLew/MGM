# MGM
MGM (Macrophytes Growth Model) is a process-based, eco-physiological model simulating the growth of submerged macrophytes under different environemntal conditions. MGM is a simplified re-implementation of Charisma 2.0 (van Nes et al. 2003) in Julia language.

For documentation, see: 
- [`docs/ODD.md`](https://github.com/AnneLew/MGM/blob/master/doc/ODD.md) 
  "Overview, Design concepts, and Details" document describing the concept of the model including differences between MGM and Charisma 2.0.
- [`Charisma 2.0`](https://www.projectenaew.wur.nl/charisma/) A comprehensive description of Charisma 2.0 including model's manual.
- [`USAGE.md`](https://github.com/AnneLew/MGM/blob/master/USAGE.md) 
  how to set up and run simulations with MGM.
