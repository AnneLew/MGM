# CharismaBiodiv
Charisma is a spatially-explicit, multi-species IBM for submerged macrophytes. It was originally published by van Nes et al. (2003); the code in this repository is a re-implementation in Julia.

For a comprehensive description of the original model, see the model's manual that can be downloaded here: https://www.projectenaew.wur.nl/charisma/ 
For documentation of differences from this version to the original one see the manual in the *doc* folder. For the source code, see the *model* folder.

Exemplary input files for lake and species parameter sets can be found in the *input_examples* folder. To run the model, the folder has to be renamed into *input*.
