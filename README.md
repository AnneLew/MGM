# Charisma Macrophyte Model

Charisma is a spatially-explicit, multi-species IBM for submerged macrophytes.
It was originally published by van Nes et al. (2003); the code in this repository
is a re-implementation in Julia.

For a comprehensive description of the original model, see the manual in the 
`doc` folder. For the source code, see the `model` folder.
